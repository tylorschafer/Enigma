# Enigma Self Assessment

## Functionality: 4 
  - I was able to add all functionality including a cracking method and command line interface. 
  - My code cracker can actually find alternative codes that also crack encrypted text.
  
## OOP: 3 
  - My project is broken down into 5 classes and two modules with single responsibilites. I have two methods that are exactly 8 lines long and have no classes longer than 100 lines. 
  - Variable names all communicate their purpose effectively.
  - Being I have two methods over 7 lines long and have no class methods, I think a 3 is an appropriate score for OOP.
  
## TDD: 4 
  - Every method and helper method is fully tested in my project, and all of the test names clearly communicate their        purpose.
  - Tests were always written before their corresponding methods.
  - I had to use a mock object and stub output in the offset class tests to test the square date and assign_subshifts methods.
  - Simplecov showing full 100% coverage.
  
## Version Control: 4.0
  - I have well over 40 commits and 15 pull requests. 
  - Pull requests and commits all document purpose clearly.
